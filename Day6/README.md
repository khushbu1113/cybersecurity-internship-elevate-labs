# Task 6: Create and Evaluate Strong Passwords

## Objective
Understand password strength, create multiple test passwords of varying complexity, and evaluate them using online and offline tools.

## Tools Used
- Online password strength checker (e.g., passwordmeter.com)
- Python + zxcvbn (`pip install zxcvbn`) for offline evaluation

## Steps Performed
1. Prepared a list of test passwords of varying complexity (short, dictionary, pattern, passphrase, random).
2. Evaluated each password online and recorded scores & suggestions.
3. Evaluated each password offline using zxcvbn to get `score`, `guesses`, and `crack_time` estimates.
4. Calculated entropy and estimated time-to-crack for example cases.
5. Documented findings, conclusions, and best practices.

## Deliverables
- `Task6_report.docx` (detailed report)
- Optional screenshots of tools and outputs

## Outcome
Gained practical understanding of what makes passwords weak or strong, how attackers estimate cracking difficulty, and best practices for secure password creation (use passphrases, randomization, password managers, and MFA).
