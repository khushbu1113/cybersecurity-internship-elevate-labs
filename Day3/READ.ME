# Task 3: Basic Vulnerability Scan on Personal Computer  

## 📌 Objective  
The objective of this task was to perform a basic vulnerability scan on a personal computer using free tools like **OpenVAS Community Edition** or **Nessus Essentials**. The scan helps in identifying potential security risks, understanding common PC vulnerabilities, and learning how to analyze and prioritize them.
